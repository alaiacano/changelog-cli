This is a simple utility to manage Changelogs. It was inspired by https://keepachangelog.com/, which has the caveat that there is no standard changelog format. Rather than try to parse arbitrary markdown, this project defines typed json schema for a Changelog and converts it to a standard Markdown format. It will also have some other utilities.

To install from source (the only way so far):

```bash
npm run build
npm install -g
```

This will give you a `changelog` command.

```bash
â–¶ changelog
Usage: Changelog Util [options] [command]

A CLI for managing changelogs

Options:
  -V, --version      output the version number
  -h, --help         display help for command

Commands:
  gen [options]
  release [options]  Moves the unreleased section to the head of the releases section and creates a new empty unreleased section.

                     This is not a versioning tool! It simply moves some text around, and doesn't actually bump versions.
  help [command]     display help for command
```

# Example: Generating Markdown

Here's an example input. Note that the `yaml-language-server` line at the top is important! You should be using the [Redhat YAML Language Support for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) (or similar) in order to get real-time verification of your syntax.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=schema.json

Running `changelog gen -y changelog.yml` produces:

```markdown

Edit example.yaml instead of this otherwise changes will likely be lost.

# Example: Making a Release

The `changelog release` command will put the `unreleased` section into the head of the `releases` list and create a new `unreleased` section for you. Running these two commands using the `changelog.yaml` from above

```bash
changelog release -y example.yaml -v 2.0.0
changelog gen -y example.yaml
```

will yield:

```markdown
